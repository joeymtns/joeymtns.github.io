        <h1>Arc – Habit Tracker – Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 25, 2026</p>
    </header>

    <section aria-labelledby="arc-privacy-intro">
        <h2 id="arc-privacy-intro">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Arc – Habit Tracker ("Arc", "we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy.
            This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and protected
            when you use the Arc iOS application (the "App").
        </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="arc-privacy-info">
        <h2 id="arc-privacy-info">2. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Personal Information</h3>
        <p>
            We do not require you to create an account to use Arc. We do not collect personally
            identifiable information such as your name, email address, or phone number directly
            through the App.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Habit and Usage Data</h3>
        <p>
            The App stores habit-related data (such as the habits you create, your completion
            history, and settings) locally on your device in order to provide core functionality.
            This data is not automatically transmitted to our servers.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3 Purchases</h3>
        <p>
            Arc may offer premium features through auto-renewable subscriptions or in-app purchases.
            Purchases are processed securely by Apple Inc. via the App Store. We do not have access to
            your full payment information, such as your complete credit card number.
        </p>

        <h3>2.4 Analytics and Crash Data (if applicable)</h3>
        <p>
            We may use privacy-friendly analytics or crash reporting tools provided by Apple or
            third parties to help improve the stability and performance of the App. Such tools may
            collect non-personally identifiable information such as device type, operating system
            version, and anonymized usage information. Any such collection is subject to the respective
            providers' privacy policies and, where required, Apple’s user consent mechanisms (for example,
            for diagnostics and usage data).
        </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="arc-privacy-use">
        <h2 id="arc-privacy-use">3. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use information (where applicable) to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the App’s functionality.</li>
            <li>Enable and manage premium features and subscriptions.</li>
            <li>Monitor the performance and reliability of the App.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We do not sell your data to third parties.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="arc-privacy-storage">
        <h2 id="arc-privacy-storage">4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
            Habit data is stored locally on your device unless otherwise stated in this Policy.
            Where we use third-party services (for example, for subscriptions, analytics, or crash
            reporting), those providers may process limited data as necessary to provide their services.
            We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information;
            however, no method of transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="arc-privacy-third-parties">
        <h2 id="arc-privacy-third-parties">5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Arc uses Apple’s in-app purchase system to process subscriptions and purchases. Apple may
            collect and process information in accordance with its own terms and privacy policies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apple’s privacy policy is available at:
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p>
            If any other third-party services are integrated in the future, we will update this Policy
            to describe how they are used.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="arc-privacy-children">
        <h2 id="arc-privacy-children">6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect
            personal information from children under 13. If you believe that a child has provided us
            with personal information, please contact us so that we can take appropriate action.
