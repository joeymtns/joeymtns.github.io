    </header>

    <section aria-labelledby="tropine-privacy-intro">
        <h2 id="tropine-privacy-intro">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Tropine ("Tropine", "we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy
            explains how information is collected, used, and protected when you use the Tropine iOS
            application (the "App").
        </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="tropine-privacy-info">
        <h2 id="tropine-privacy-info">2. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Personal Information</h3>
        <p>
            We do not require you to create an account to use Tropine. We do not collect personally
            identifiable information such as your name, email address, or phone number directly through
            the App, unless we explicitly state otherwise within the App.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 App Content and Usage Data</h3>
        <p>
            The App may store content and settings you create within Tropine (for example, configuration
            data, preferences, or other app-specific information) locally on your device in order to provide
            core functionality. This data is not automatically transmitted to our servers.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3 Purchases</h3>
        <p>
            Tropine may offer paid features via in-app purchases or subscriptions. Purchases are processed
            securely by Apple Inc. via the App Store. We do not have access to your full payment information,
            such as your complete credit card number.
        </p>

        <h3>2.4 Analytics and Crash Data (if applicable)</h3>
        <p>
            We may use privacy-friendly analytics or crash reporting tools to help us understand how the App
            is used and to improve its stability and performance. Such tools may collect non-personally
            identifiable information such as device type, operating system version, and anonymized usage
            information. Any such collection is subject to the respective providers’ privacy policies and
            Apple’s user consent mechanisms where required.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="tropine-privacy-use">
        <h2 id="tropine-privacy-use">3. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use information (where applicable) to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the App.</li>
            <li>Enable and manage any paid or premium features.</li>
            <li>Monitor the performance, stability, and usage of the App.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We do not sell your data to third parties.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="tropine-privacy-storage">
        <h2 id="tropine-privacy-storage">4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
            Data generated by your use of Tropine is primarily stored locally on your device, unless otherwise
            stated in this Policy or within the App. If we integrate cloud-based services or synchronization
            features in the future, we will clearly describe what data is stored and how it is protected. We use
            reasonable safeguards to protect your information, but no method of transmission or storage can be
            guaranteed to be completely secure.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="tropine-privacy-third-parties">
        <h2 id="tropine-privacy-third-parties">5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The App may use third-party services such as Apple’s in-app purchase system, analytics tools,
            or crash reporting providers. These services may collect certain limited information as necessary
            to provide their functionality, and they operate under their own terms and privacy policies.

        <p>
            The App is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal
            information from children under 13. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal
            information, please contact us so that we can take appropriate action.
